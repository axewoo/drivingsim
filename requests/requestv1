PA2 - 15 PZ+ ; Encoder signal output port Z 

Work requested : 
By using the ressources given earlier , write a program in C that can be used to read and send values to the motor driver using PWM to make the motor spin and to be able to know it's position in real time (it will have a drivingsim use).
 
Moreover, implement in the same C program a function that will use these values to make the motor a force feedback wheel for driving simulators and games.
Finally, the program will send the force feedback and position values to a windows computer using USB and USART : For that you can write a seperate application or implement in the first program.
